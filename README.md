Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a webpage game. Creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a simple yet engaging project that helps you understand the fundamentals of web development. The game revolves around the classic rules where the user and the computer each choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and the winner is determined based on predefined rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

The project is divided into three main parts: 
1. HTML,
2. CSS, and 
3. JavaScript. 

The HTML provides the basic structure for the game, such as buttons for the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors, a section to display the computer's choice, and an area to show the result of the game. It acts as the skeleton of the application.

The visual design and layout of the game are handled by CSS. This includes styling the buttons, arranging elements on the screen, and making the interface visually appealing. CSS can also be used to add animations or hover effects to enhance the user experience.

JavaScript is the heart of the game and handles all the interactivity. It captures the user’s choice when they click a button, generates a random choice for the computer, compares the two choices to determine the winner, and dynamically updates the HTML to display the result. You can also implement additional features like a scoring system to keep track of wins, losses, and draws or even add sounds and animations for a more engaging experience.

This project is an excellent way to learn how to link HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to build a fully interactive application. It’s also highly customizable, allowing you to add your creative touches, such as themes or advanced animations
